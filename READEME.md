In the culmination of two years and one semester, my web application project, the "Online Hotel Reservation System," stands as a testament to the fusion of Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript technologies. Achieving an exceptional score of 91%, the project exemplifies a harmonious blend of technical proficiency and innovative design. Seamlessly integrating both front-end and back-end elements, the system offers a user-friendly interface, ensuring a smooth and secure hotel booking experience.

The strategic use of Java ensures robust functionality, while HTML and CSS contribute to an aesthetically pleasing layout. JavaScript enhances interactivity, creating a dynamic platform. Our project's success lies not only in its technical intricacies but also in its advantageous features, such as streamlined reservation processes, secure data handling, and an intuitive user interface. This accomplishment reflects a commitment to excellence, showcasing the ability to deliver a high-performing web application that addresses real-world needs in the hospitality industry.
